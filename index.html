                            ‘Still I Rise’ – these are the words emblazoned across the back of Lewis Hamilton’s helmet 
                            and tattooed across his shoulders, and ever since annihilating expectations with one of the
                            greatest rookie performances in F1 history in 2007, that’s literally all he’s done: risen to 
                            the top of the all-time pole positions list ahead of his hero Ayrton Senna, surged into first 
                            place in the wins column surpassing the inimitable Michael Schumacher, and then matched the legendary German’s seven world titles. <br> <br>

                            Is he the G.O.A.T? Few would deny that he’s in the conversation – and what’s more he’s got 
                            there his way, twinning his relentless speed with a refusal to conform to stereotypes for how a 
                            racing driver should think, dress or behave. <br> <br>
                            
                            Respect is hard earned in F1, but Hamilton – now Lewis Hamilton to be precise – has it from 
                            every one of his peers. Why? Because they know that whatever the track, whatever the conditions, 
                            whatever the situation, when his visor goes down and the lights go out, it’s Hammertime.

                                    <p id="newsbox-description">Mercedes became the penultimate team to launch for 
                                        2024 by revealing their new F1 car challenger. The team will be hoping to 
                                        take a step forwards in 2024 in what will be Lewis Hamilton's final season with
                                        the squad prior to his switch to Ferrari in 2025.
